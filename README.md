# 👋 Hello there, I’m Ashane
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science
- 🌱 I've completed CS50x
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet
- 📫 How to reach me: Email (<6752@tiffin.kingston.sch.uk>)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born with prearicular pits in both my ears. A prearicular pit is a little hole in the side of an ear, only found in 1/100 babies born. Since I have two, you could say I'm doubly as special! (not really)
